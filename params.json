You could find the `main-nav.yaml` data file under `_data/` directory. You could add any number of menu items by modifying `main-nav.yaml`. \r\n\r\nAn example of `main-nav.yaml`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n- title: \"About me\" # Title/Caption of the menu item\r\n  href: \"/about\" # the page where it pointed\r\n- title: \"Blog Archive\"\r\n  href: \"/archive\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt some point you want to link an external URL, in that case you could edit the `_includes/sidebar.html` file. See the following example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<nav class=\"sidebar-nav\">\r\n   <a class=\"sidebar-nav-item\" \r\n      href=\"http://www.example.com\"\r\n      target=\"_blank\">\r\n      Example site\r\n    </a>\r\n</nav>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n(The MIT License)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2014 Gayan Virajith\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
